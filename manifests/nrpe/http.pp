# == Define: nagios::nrpe::http
#
# This class will allow us to check the http response from a server. This will
# currently respond with OK for a 200/300 response, Warning for a 400 response,
# and Critical for no response. This  may want to be tuned. There is also an
# option in the check (but not this manifest) to allow greater response parsing.
# This can be integrated later as situations require.
#
# Note: This require the server having nagios::server::clean or the commands
# manually defined.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*namevar*]
#   The hostname will default to the name of the resource. This is the hostname
#   that the check will send the request to. This will bypass dns, but will make
#   impacts on web servers with more than one hostname and also servers serving
#   https (complete necessity here).
#
# [*health_check_url*]
#   The sub url to check i.e. /ping or /health_check.
#   Not required. Defaults to /
#
# [*port*]
#   The port to check. Annoyingly, will require an override if you use https
#   (set it to 443), as the default is 80.
#   Not required. Defaults to 80
#
# [*has_parent*]
#   Whether this http response has a parent service dependency (eg nginx,
#   tomcat).
#   Not required. Defaults to true.
#
# [*parent_service*]
#   The name of the parent host, if has_parent is set to true (eg
#   ${hostname}).
#   Defaults to $::hostname. Not required.
#
# [*parent_service*]
#   The name of the parent service, if has_parent is set to true (eg
#   ${hostname}_check_nginx).
#   Required if has parent is true. Defaults to "".
#
#   Note: This is not tested.
#
# [*ssl*]
#   Boolean for whether it should use http or https. Note: You will have to
#   change the port as well!
#   Not required. Defaults to false.
#
# [*monitoring_environment*]
#   This is the environment that the check will be submitted for. This will
#   default to the value set by nagios::nrpe::config but can be overridden here.
#   Not required. 
#
# [*nagios_service*]
#   This is the generic service that this check will implement. This should
#   be set by nagios::nrpe::config but can be overridden here. Not required.
#
# [*nagios_alias*]
#   This is the hostname that the check will be submitted for. This should
#   almost always be the hostname, but could be overriden, for instance when
#   submitting a check for a virtual ip. Not required.
#
# === Variables
#
# [*service_description*]
#   A placeholder for the service description that makes it slightly neater to
#   read.
#
# [*command*]
#   This is the command that nrpe will use to check the file count.
#
# [*protocol*]
#   The represents the string for the connection protocol. Translation of ssl.
#
# [*expect*]
#   The represents the string to expect.
